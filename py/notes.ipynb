    "- **Identifiers:** Identifiers are names given to various program elements such as variables, functions, classes, etc. They are case-sensitive and must follow certain rules:\n",
    "     - Must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or underscore (_)\n",
    "     - Can be followed by letters, digits (0-9), or underscores\n",
    "     - Cannot be a Python keyword (reserved word)\n",
    "- **Keywords:** Keywords are predefined reserved words in Python that have special meanings and cannot be used as identifiers. For eg: `if`, `else`, `while`, `for`, `class`, `def`, `import`, `True`, `False`, `None`, etc\n",
    "- **Statements:** A statement is a complete line of code that performs a specific action. Python programs consist of a sequence of statements. Common types of statements include assignment statements, conditional statements (if, elif, else), loop statements (for, while), and function calls\n",
    "- **Expressions:** An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators that can be evaluated to produce a result. Expressions can be simple, like a variable or a literal value, or complex, involving arithmetic, logical, or comparison operators\n",
    "- **Variables:** Variables are used to store data values. They are identifiers associated with a memory location where data is stored. They must be declared (assigned a value) before they can be used\n",

    "### Memory management\n",
    "Memory management in Python is handled by the Python memory manager, which includes several components to ensure efficient memory usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reference Counting:** Python uses reference counting to keep track of how many references exist for each object. When an object's reference count drops to zero, it is automatically deleted (garbage collected)\n",
    "2. **Garbage Collection:** Python also employs a garbage collector to identify and collect cyclic references, which reference counting alone cannot handle. The cyclic garbage collector detects and cleans up objects involved in circular references\n",
    "3. **Memory Allocation:** Python's memory manager handles the allocation and deallocation of memory for objects dynamically. It ensures that memory is efficiently allocated and released as needed\n",
    "4. **Memory Pools:** Python uses memory pools to manage memory allocation more efficiently. It divides memory into blocks of fixed sizes and allocates objects from these pools, reducing fragmentation and memory overhead\n",
    "5. **Automatic Memory Management:** Python automatically manages memory for you, so you don't have to explicitly allocate or deallocate memory. This simplifies memory management and reduces the risk of memory leaks\n",
    "6. **Caching and Reusing Objects:** Python caches and reuses certain immutable objects, like small integers and strings. This optimization reduces memory usage and improves performance\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### OOP-ness\n",
    "1. **Objects and Classes:** Python allows you to define and use classes, which serve as blueprints for creating objects. Objects are instances of classes, and they encapsulate data and behavior\n",
    "2. **Encapsulation:** OOP in Python promotes encapsulation, where data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data are grouped together within a class, providing a clear and organized structure\n",
    "3. **Inheritance:** Python supports inheritance, allowing you to create new classes that inherit properties and behaviors from existing classes. Inheritance promotes code reuse and hierarchy\n",
    "4. **Polymorphism:** Polymorphism is a key OOP concept in Python. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. This simplifies code and promotes flexibility\n",
    "5. **Abstraction:** Abstraction in Python involves hiding complex implementation details and exposing a simplified interface. This simplification helps developers use classes and objects without needing to understand their internal workings\n",
    "6. **Method Overriding:** Python allows you to override methods inherited from a base class in a derived class, providing flexibility and customization\n",
    "Here's a simple example of a Python class to illustrate the object-oriented nature of the language:"

    "- Written partially in python, most of the parts requiring fast computation utilise C or C++\n",
    "- It’s the universal standard for working with numerical data in Python, and it’s at the core of the scientific python and libraries like numpy, scikit-learn, and pandas\n",
    "- It provides ndarray, a homogeneous n-dimensional array object, with methods to efficiently operate on it\n",
    "- It can be used to perform a wide variety of mathematical operations on arrays\n",
    "- It adds powerful data structures to Pthon that guarantee efficient calculations with arrays and matrices and it supplies an enormous library of high-level mathematical functions that operate on these arrays and matrices\n",
    "- NumPy is a general-purpose array-processing package\n",
    "- It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays\n",
    "- It contains various features including these important ones:\n",
