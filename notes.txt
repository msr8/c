-- FORMAT SPECIFIERS --

%d  | int    (%d is ALWAYS base 10)
%u  | unsigned int
%f  | float  (stores 7  decimal digits)
%lf | double (stores 15 decimal digits)
%LF | long double
%s  | string
%c  | char
%o  | octal
%x  | hexadecimal
%lu | unsigned long (returned by sizeof())
%p  | pointer (used in like, `printf("%p",&x)`), here & is necessary

-> You can do something like %03d, so that the integer printed will be of 3 digits. The left is padded with 0s
-> You can do something like %.3f, so that only 3 digits will be printed after the .



-- LOGICAL OPERATORS --
&& | and
|| | or



-- KEYWORDS --

break     | same as python
continue  | same as python
sizeof(x) | returns the amount of storage occupied by `x` (in bytes)



-- FOR STATEMENT --
for (statement, condition, operation) {}

statement is the statement that is executed once when the loop is started, ie an assignment operation
condition is the condition which decides if the code block will run. If it returns true, the code block will be ran
operation is the operation done on the value assigned in `statement` to make sure that `condition` returns true when needed to. It is executed after the code block has been ran

for (int i = 0; i <= 5; i++) {
    printf("%d ", i);
}

OUTPUT: 0 1 2 3 4 5

ITS THE SAME AS

int i = 0;
while (i<=5) {
    printf("%d ", i);
    i++;
}



-- LOOPING THRO AN ARRAY --

int array[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
int size    = (int)( sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0]) );
for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    printf("%d ", array[i]);
}



-- CONVERTING INT TO CHAR[] --

char x[100] = "";
sprintf(x, "%d", 11);
printf("This is x: %s", x);

OUPUT: This is x: 11
