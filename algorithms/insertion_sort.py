Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by building a final sorted list one item at a time. It works \
similarly to how many people sort a hand of playing cards.

The algorithm works as follows:

1) Start by considering the first element in the list to be the sorted portion of the list, and the rest of the elements to be the unsorted portion
2) Take the first element in the unsorted portion and insert it into the correct position in the sorted portion of the list
3) Repeat step 2 with the next element in the unsorted portion, inserting it into the correct position in the sorted portion of the list
4) Continue this process until all elements in the unsorted portion have been inserted into the sorted portion

Insertion sort has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case scenario, which makes it inefficient for large lists. \
However, it has the advantage of being simple and efficient for small lists, and it can perform well on partially sorted \
lists
