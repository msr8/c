============================== BINARY SEARCH ==============================

ARR   = array of numbers. It must be sorted
VAL   = item which location has to be found
IND   = index of val
START = starting index of sub-list we want to perform the search on
END   = ending index of sub-list we want to perform the search on
MID   = middle index of sub-list we want to perform the search on

(this algo is for ascending order)

1) INITIALIZE
    START = 0/1 (depending on language)
    END   = last index of array

2) Repeat step 3 and 4 while END>START and ARR[MID]!=VAL

3) MID = (int)( (start+end) / 2)

4) IF DATA[MID] > VAL:    END   = MID-1
   ELSE:                  START = MID+1

5) IF DATA[MID]==VAL:     IND = MID
   ELSE:                  IND = NULL
